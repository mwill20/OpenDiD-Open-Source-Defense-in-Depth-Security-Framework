# Defense-in-Depth Security Stack Implementation

This repository demonstrates a comprehensive Defense-in-Depth (DiD) network infrastructure implementation using various security tools and platforms.

## Architecture Components

1. **Network Visibility & Control**
   - NVIS Software Defined Parameter for network segmentation and control

2. **Endpoint Security**
   - Bitdefender EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)
   - Action1 MRR (Managed Risk & Response)

3. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**
   - Wazuh SIEM
   - Splunk SIEM

4. **Security Orchestration**
   - TheHive (Open-source SOAR platform)
